# Retro Game Recreation
This project was created as part of a university assignment. The aim of the assignment was to use a combination of external libraries with C++, to develop a 2d retro game engine that would then be used to create a 2d retro game. For this project I used the 2d engine to create the classic arcade game; PacMan.

To Play the game, open the exe file within the 'Release' folder and then press the number key relating to the option you want.

CONTROLS: WASD
